# 🔐 Ethical Hacking: Password Cracking Labs  

This repository showcases my **ethical hacking practice** in password recovery using open-source tools.  
The focus is on **multi-layer password cracking**: a password-protected ZIP file that contains a second protected PDF.  

💡 This project is **strictly for educational purposes** on my **own test files** in a controlled lab environment.
