# 🔐 Ethical Hacking: Password Cracking Practice 
Study repo for ethical hacking password recovery labs — ZIP &amp; PDF cracking using open-source tools (John the Ripper, pdfcrack, fcrackzip). For educational use only.
 

Welcome to my **ethical hacking lab repository**! 🚀  
Here, I document my journey of learning how to recover forgotten passwords from protected files in a **safe, controlled, and legal environment**.  

This project focuses on:  
- 🗂️ **ZIP password recovery** with tools like John the Ripper,zip2john & fcrackzip  
- 📑 **PDF password recovery** using pdfcrack (demo only, no direct commands)  
- 🧠 Exploring **dictionary attacks, brute force attacks, and hash extraction**  
- 🎓 Practicing cybersecurity skills for my studies in **ethical hacking**  

💡 The purpose of this repo is not to “hack” random files, but to **understand security weaknesses** so that better protections can be built.  
Think of it as learning how locks work 🔑 — not to break into houses, but to become a locksmith.  

⚠️ **Disclaimer:**  
This repository is strictly for **educational purposes only**.  
All files used are ones I created myself for lab practice.  
❌ Never use these techniques on files you don’t own or without permission.
